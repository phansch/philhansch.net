# Getting started with open source

 * Intro
   * Who I am and what this talk is about
   * Quick git intro to what git is about conceptually
 * Middle
   * Start by showing what I did on GitHub directly
   * Continue with criteria for a good project
    * Activity: Amount of issues / pull requests / comments
    * Documentation
    * Manageble size (Probably not firefox)
   * then go back to slides and repeat the points
 * Ending
   * Show list of newbie friendly open source projects
   * recap
   * Questions



New idea:

 * Start by going over my projects, explaining how they are all small. then there's always been this thing in my head: open source
 * Daunting: Show actual quotes from git/linux patches gone wrong - transition to - i was scared

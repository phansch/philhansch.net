          <h3 class="p-name">The website is now licensed</h3>
          <div class="e-content"><p>With the <a href="https://philhansch.net/notes/hello-statichost-eu/">move to Codeberg</a> last week,
came another task. Codeberg requires that projects hosted on the
platform have an open license. And it turns out I never had a license for this website.</p>
<p>After some deliberation, I decided to license all text and assets as <strong>CC BY-NC</strong>
and the code behind the website as <strong>MIT</strong>.</p>
<p>This is now reflected in LICENSE files in the repository and on a <a href="https://philhansch.net/license/">new
licensing page</a> as well as in the footer.</p>

          <h3 class="p-name">Hello statichost.eu and Codeberg, bye GitHub</h3>
          <div class="e-content"><p>In 2012 I moved my website
<a href="https://philhansch.net/posts/hellogithub/">from Wordpress to GitHub</a>. And today,
13 years later, I moved it to
<a href="https://codeberg.org/philhansch/philhansch.net">Codeberg</a> and
<a href="https://statichost.eu">statichost.eu</a>. I had a git mirror up on Codeberg for
a few months already, and today I moved over the hosting to statichost.eu as
well.</p>
<p>This was all inspired by a blog post from stardust:
<a href="https://www.arscyni.cc/file/codeberg.html">The how and why of GitHub to Codeberg</a>.
Thanks to that post, this just took 20 minutes. Not including procrastinating
to update the DNS settings.</p>
<p>CI is currently not running on pushes, but using a simple git pre-commit hook
locally should be enough for now.</p>
<p>In any case, I want to keep this short. I'm currently trying very hard to use
as little tech in my free time as possible, but that's probably worth a full
blog post, which I don't really want to spend time on right now.</p>

          <h3 class="p-name">25 minute Pomodoros do not work for me</h3>
          <div class="e-content"><p>I use the Pomodoro technique when I have trouble getting started and staying
focused on tasks.</p>
<p>This is how it usually went in the past:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>00:00</em>: I start my Pomodoro timer and my favorite playlist.</li>
<li><em>00:30</em>: I start to work on the task, building a mental model, perhaps.
Or writing something on my blog.</li>
<li><em>10:00</em>: I make some progress, take some notes.</li>
<li><em>15:00</em>: I'm starting to get into the zone.</li>
<li><em>22:00</em>: In the zone, the outside world doesn't exist, nothing can stop me now.</li>
<li><em>25:00</em>: BEEP BEEP BEEP</li>
<li>And I'm no longer in the zone.</li>
</ol>
<p>25 minute Pomodoros don't work for me and I didn't realize that until a
few weeks ago. Maybe this can also be generalized so far that 25 minute
Pomodoros don't work when you want to get into the zone for longer.</p>
<p>I now use 50 minute Pomodoros with 5-10 minute breaks and the change has
been very noticeable.</p>

          <h3 class="p-name">&#x27;Sponsor Me&#x27; page removed</h3>
          <div class="e-content"><p>I've removed the link to my sponsor page, because I haven't taken sponsors
since 2021. The reality is, I've been burnt out of tech for a while now,
website updates didn't have priority, and I don't see myself taking money for
OSS work in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>I have a more detailed post on my burnout coming up. Maybe this week - I've been
slowly crawling out of my burnout recently.</p>

          <h3 class="p-name">I gave VSCode a try for 9 months</h3>
          <div class="e-content"><p>There's probably a full blog post in here somewhere. For the past few months
I've been using VSCode for work and private projects. I grew tired of
breaking plugins and changing configs all the time. I'm a big fan of robust
tech and my neovim experience has been very far from that. I want to spend as
little time as possible thinking about configs. The majority of my computer
time should not be spent working on my <a href="https://github.com/phansch/dotfiles">dotfiles</a>.</p>
<p>VSCode solves this problem by having plugins that almost always just work.
Especially when it comes to Language Server plugins, there's a world of
difference. So around 9 months ago I started using VSCode as my main editor.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today, there are two main reasons I'm now switching back to
neovim:</p>
<ul>
<li>VSCode ended up being a memory hog on my Dell XPS 13 from 2018. I ran out of
memory multiple times.</li>
<li>The UI of VSCode is distracting and annoying to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I'm using <a href="http://www.lazyvim.org/">LazyVim</a> to take care of my LSP setup and hope that it doesn't
break as often. I essentially outsourced most of my neovim configuration. I can still
configure neovim to have a distraction-free UI, be resource-friendly and most
important, not break on every plugin update.</p>
<p>Let's see what it looks like after another 9 months.</p>

          <h3 class="p-name">Small website updates</h3>
          <div class="e-content"><p>Over the past couple of days I've spent some time to update the website. Maybe it's a sign that my <a href="https://philhansch.net/posts/tech-burnout/">burnout</a> is getting manageable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Links underlined for improved accessibility.</li>
<li>New link list on the home page (Inspired by <a href="https://mastodon.social/@muan">@muan</a>).</li>
<li>Removed the 'Reading' page and added a link to my <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/philh">Storygraph</a> page.</li>
<li>I can write notes now. The most recent are listed <a href="https://philhansch.net/notes/">here</a></li>
<li>Using CSS custom properties for variables - I'm very much behind on frontend tech. <a href="https://github.com/phansch/philhansch.net/commit/eb1292d5bbcf377fd7f121c21bbed1e22b07bfc1">commit</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm still not 100% happy with the home page, so I will continue working on it this week. I want to improve the look of the timeline as well as update references to my Rust involvement (I'm not involved anymore, for now).</p>

          <h3 class="p-name">A notes section for the website</h3>
          <div class="e-content"><p>I decided I want to write more on here, but I also don't want the pressure of writing a full blog post every time I get the urge to write. So I set up this notes section that gives me a separate space to dump my current thoughts without much editing.</p>
<p>So here goes my first note.</p>

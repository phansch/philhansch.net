title = "The website is now licensed"

With the [move to Codeberg](@/notes/2025-08-09-hello-statichost-eu.md) last week,
came another task. Codeberg requires that projects hosted on the
platform have an open license. And it turns out I never had a license for this website.

After some deliberation, I decided to license all text and assets as **CC BY-NC**
and the code behind the website as **MIT**.

This is now reflected in LICENSE files in the repository and on a [new
licensing page](@/license.md) as well as in the footer.

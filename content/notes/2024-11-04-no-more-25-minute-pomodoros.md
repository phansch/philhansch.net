title = "25 minute Pomodoros do not work for me"
+++

I use the Pomodoro technique when I have trouble getting started and staying
focused on tasks.

This is how it usually went in the past:

1. _00:00_: I start my Pomodoro timer and my favorite playlist.
2. _00:30_: I start to work on the task, building a mental model, perhaps.
    Or writing something on my blog.
3. _10:00_: I make some progress, take some notes.
4. _15:00_: I'm starting to get into the zone.
5. _22:00_: In the zone, the outside world doesn't exist, nothing can stop me now.
6. _25:00_: BEEP BEEP BEEP
7. And I'm no longer in the zone.

25 minute Pomodoros don't work for me and I didn't realize that until a
few weeks ago. Maybe this can also be generalized so far that 25 minute
Pomodoros don't work when you want to get into the zone for longer.

I now use 50 minute Pomodoros with 5-10 minute breaks and the change has
been very noticeable.

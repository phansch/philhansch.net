title = "I gave VSCode a try for 9 months"

There's probably a full blog post in here somewhere. For the past few months
I've been using VSCode for work and private projects. I grew tired of
breaking plugins and changing configs all the time. I'm a big fan of robust
tech and my neovim experience has been very far from that. I want to spend as
little time as possible thinking about configs. The majority of my computer
time should not be spent working on my [dotfiles].

VSCode solves this problem by having plugins that almost always just work.
Especially when it comes to Language Server plugins, there's a world of
difference. So around 9 months ago I started using VSCode as my main editor.

Fast-forward to today, there are two main reasons I'm now switching back to
neovim:

* VSCode ended up being a memory hog on my Dell XPS 13 from 2018. I ran out of
memory multiple times.
* The UI of VSCode is distracting and annoying to use.

Now I'm using [LazyVim] to take care of my LSP setup and hope that it doesn't
break as often. I essentially outsourced most of my neovim configuration. I can still
configure neovim to have a distraction-free UI, be resource-friendly and most
important, not break on every plugin update.

Let's see what it looks like after another 9 months.

title = "'Sponsor Me' page removed"

I've removed the link to my sponsor page, because I haven't taken sponsors
since 2021. The reality is, I've been burnt out of tech for a while now,
website updates didn't have priority, and I don't see myself taking money for
OSS work in the foreseeable future.

I have a more detailed post on my burnout coming up. Maybe this week - I've been
slowly crawling out of my burnout recently.

title = "Hello statichost.eu and Codeberg, bye GitHub"

In 2012 I moved my website
[from Wordpress to GitHub](@/posts/2012-07-26-HelloGitHub.md). And today,
13 years later I moved it to
[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/philhansch/philhansch.net) and
[statichost.eu](https://statichost.eu). I had a git mirror up on Codeberg for
a few months already, and today I moved over the hosting to statichost.eu as
well.

This was all inspired by a blog post from stardust:
[The how and why of GitHub to Codeberg](https://www.arscyni.cc/file/codeberg.html).
Thanks to that post, this just took 20 minutes. Not including procrastinating
to update the DNS settings.

CI is currently not running on pushes, but using a simple git pre-commit
locally should be enough for now.

In any case, I want to keep this short. I'm currently trying very hard to use
as little tech in my free time as possible, but that's probably worth a full
blog post, which I don't really want to spend time on right now.

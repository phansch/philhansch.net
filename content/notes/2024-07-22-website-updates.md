title = "Small website updates"
+++

Over the past couple of days I've spent some time to update the website. Maybe it's a sign that my [burnout](@/posts/2024-07-18-tech-burnout.md) is getting manageable.

* Links underlined for improved accessibility.
* New link list on the home page (Inspired by [@muan](https://mastodon.social/@muan)).
* Removed the 'Reading' page and added a link to my [Storygraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/philh) page.
* I can write notes now. The most recent are listed [here](@/notes/_index.md)
* Using CSS custom properties for variables - I'm very much behind on frontend tech. [commit](https://github.com/phansch/philhansch.net/commit/eb1292d5bbcf377fd7f121c21bbed1e22b07bfc1)

I'm still not 100% happy with the home page, so I will continue working on it this week. I want to improve the look of the timeline as well as update references to my Rust involvement (I'm not involved anymore, for now).

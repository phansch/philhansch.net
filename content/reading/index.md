# My reading list

Books I've read, currently reading and want to read. I started this list in early 2014 after reading *Apprenticeship Patterns* by Dave Hoover. This does not only include technical books.

If you think I'm missing an important book on this list, [let me know](http://twitter.com/philhansch).

## What I've worked on

February has been quite a non-productive month from the outside. Maybe it's the
winter blues finally catching up to me, but that's for the next section of the
post.

It indeed doesn't look like a lot in terms of merged PRs this month. The only
merged PR is to the `rustc-guide` where I've added an [introductory
section][rustc_guide_pr] to the _Name Resolution_ chapter.

I've been learning about name resolution in rustc because I've been looking into
making some improvements to a rustc diagnostic that is emitted exactly during
name resolution. So that instead of this:

```rust
12 |  let _ = HashNap::new();
   |          ^^^^^^^
   |          |
   |          use of undeclared type or module `HashNap`
```

You will get an additional suggestion of the most likely alternative:


```rust
12 |  let _ = HashNap::new();
   |          ^^^^^^^
   |          |
   |          use of undeclared type or module `HashNap`
   |          help: a struct with a similar name exists: `HashMap`
```

This PR has taken most of my time and energy in February. I want to finish it
this month and continue with work around name resolution.

## Reflections

I did not get further into embedded development as I ran into issues with my
tools, which I was hoping to avoid by jumping into embedded development.

Instead of doing more embedded development, I've started looking into
`librustc_resolve`. Specifically [a PR to improve some diagnostics][resolve_pr]
as mentioned above.  This PR has apparently triggered some sort of impostor
feeling in me. While working on this PR I noticed two things:

1. In the beginning I had absolutely no idea what `librustc_resolve` is about,
   lowering my confidence in completing this PR
2. My low confidence in completing the PR also produced feelings of guilt when
   asking otherwise busy contributors for help

In the future I hope this feeling will go away as I dig further into rustc.
Until then, I plan to 'just' push through these feelings, keeping my main goal
in the back of my head: Making diagnostics and lints better for rust users.

## Goals

For this March I have the following goals:

* Finishing up [the mentioned PR][resolve_pr]
* Further improving the name resolution chapter of the rustc-guide
* Potentially do more work around `librustc_resolve` diagnostics

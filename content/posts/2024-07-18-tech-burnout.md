It's been 18 days since I handed over the keys at my last job and over 30 days since I opened my editor, in which in writing this post right now.

I'm tired. I'm not sure where I'm going with this, but I'm tired.

<ul style="list-style: none">
<li>I'm  tired of selling myself on social media.
<li>I'm tired of algorithmic feeds.
<li>I'm tired of tech that makes my life more complicated.
<li>I'm tired of tech that doesn't solve actual problems.
<li>I'm tired of toxic productivity.
<li>I'm tired of relaxing with the goal of more productivity.
<li>I'm tired of doomscrolling.
<li>I'm tired of overly complex tech.
<li>I'm tired of working in tech and not working to limit its destructive potential.
<li>I'm tired of buzzwords.
<li>I'm tired of the current web.
<li>I'm tired of constant stimulation.
</ul>


So I've been spending more time outside. And apart from cycling I've also picked up running a few weeks ago. All this 'being tired' may sound a bit alarming, but in the past 30 days I've more happy than I've been in a long time. I haven't written any code, haven't kept up-to-date with tech news, haven't had to solve fake-problems. I need a break for the sake of taking a break.

This past Sunday I joined a group ride and rode 175km, following the complete Berlin wall trail:

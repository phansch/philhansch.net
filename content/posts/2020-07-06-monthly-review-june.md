## Sponsors

I'm incredibly thankful to the following people for sponsoring my open source
work this past month: [@repi], [@oli-obk] and [@yaahc].

If you like what I'm doing and want to support my work, please consider
sponsoring me on [Patreon][patreon] or [via other
means](@/thanks/index.md) ðŸ§¡

## What I've worked on

Four code contributions got merged this month:

* [Add regression test for endless loop][#5673]
* [Add regression test for `string_lit_as_bytes` issue ][#5672]
* [Cleanup: Use rustc's `same_type` for our `same_tys` ][#5528]
* [Deprecate regex_macro lint][#5760]

I've reviewed and approved [13 pull requests][reviewed].

Apart from that, I migrated this blog from Jekyll to Zola and I have a separate
blog post in the pipeline for that. I also started work on a private project
that uses Rust ([tide]) in the backend but it's too early for details.

## Reflections

### Reviewing pull requests

Clippy has now been using [rust-highfive] for two months and we're down to 14
open PRs currently. `rust-highfive` has removed *so* much pressure and guilt, I
can't say enough how much it helped me with long-term motivation as a reviewer.

### `qwerty` touch typing

I didn't practice enough touch typing in May so I'm still not consistently
writing at 80WPM, rather at 70WPM. However, since I'm using it every day, my vim
muscle memory is back to what it was before. At the end of June I started
having some minor pain in my left hand due to an inconvenient <kbd>CTRL</kbd>
key placement. I've since changed that and hope it will be better this way.

## Goals

* My primary goal for July is to get one of my private projects to a finished
  MVP that I can talk about.
* I think that my Clippy activity will stay at the current level for now.
* Reviews will get the highest priority and I will continue to fix bugs.
* I want to do daily touch typing exercises again.

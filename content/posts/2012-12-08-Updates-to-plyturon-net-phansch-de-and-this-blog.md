As of today, the domain *plyturon.net* is free to grab. I removed the old landing page and the tools as well.
I also removed everything filed under *games.phansch.de*. That also includes the [RIFT macro translator](@/posts/2012-02-03-the-rift-macro-system.md).

phansch.de is now pointing directly to this blog.
Furthermore, I'm planning on canceling my current webhosting contract and just keeping my domain at [namecheap.com](http://namecheap.com).

As for the blog theme, I hope to have an overhaul ready until the end of the year.

I have been reading [Apprenticeship Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Apprenticeship-Patterns-Guidance-Aspiring-Craftsman/dp/0596518382) by Dave Hoover and I found a lot of the patterns really helpful. The first thing I put into practice, was to read books and maintain a [reading list](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/philh).

However, this post is not about that. It's about a different pattern: **Expose Your Ignorance**

The idea about exposing your ignorance is to put away your pride. To make a list of things you don't know.

Check out my list ~~[here](#)~~.

Creating my list has helped me realize where I need to dig deeper. For example, notice the lack of items on my Ruby and Rails list. You could say that I know a lot about Rails because the list is very short. But in reality, I  haven't really dug deep into Rails and it shows in the lack of specific questions.

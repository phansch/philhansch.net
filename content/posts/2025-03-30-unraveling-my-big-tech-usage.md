Over the past few months I've been on a renewed mission to leave various Google, Meta, and Amazon services behind.

This renewed mission is driven by a few thoughts that have been on the back of my mind for a while now:

* Instagram ads are really creepy. One moment you're talking about a thing with friends and the next day you get adverts for that thing that was talked about.
* I want to own the things that I pay money for, I don't want to manage subscriptions.
* I don't want to lose access to something that I paid for.
* I value my privacy and that of the people around me.
* It gives me something to do in the face of.. what's happening right now.

An assortment of notes about my current (2025-03-30) progress:

## Not Started
### WhatsApp
My family and neighbors are using it and I don't see myself successfully advocating for changing to Signal. I'm using it as little as possible.
### YouTube (Web, TV)
It will probably be some time before I stop using YouTube. Maybe I can watch without being logged in. And keep my subscriptions in bookmarks instead. Ideally I would watch less YouTube in general.
### Various Google Apps
Contacts, Files, Messages, Digital Wellbeing, Play Store.
Perhaps at some point I will try out Lineage or Graphene OS, but I need to figure out if my bank supports a way to approve transactions with a non-Google OS.

## In Progress
### GitHub â†’ Codeberg
Just started. The plan is to have everything on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org) _and_ GitHub for now.
GitHub Actions for my dotfiles and website will just be run locally instead.

### Instagram â†’ ðŸ—‘
Still have one account. I stopped posting, I'm not using the App anymore. At some point this year I will delete that account as well.

### Amazon â†’ ðŸ—‘
* Still have an account but plans to delete it soon-ish. I need to figure out if I can get my regular food purchases from other places (very likely).
* I also got a hold of all my `.epub` files and started using Calibre.

### Google Photos -> Immich or Ente
* I'm currently looking at [immich.app](https://immich.app) and [ente.io](https://ente.io).
* Used Google Takeout to get a local backup of all my photos.
* I still need to add them to my local NAS and back them up automatically, too. 

## Done
### Google Contacts â†’ CardDav (via Fastmail)
* No issues here. I put in a bit of work to de-duplicate and clean up my contacts while I was doing this.
### Google Maps â†’ Organic Maps
- I removed my contributions
- I'm keeping my saved places for now
- Only really missing the reviews
- I've imported my saved places via Google takeout and the Organic Maps import feature 
### Google Camera â†’ Open Camera
* Not much to complain about, but I don't take a lot of pictures with my phone anyway. I'm missing the built-in QR code scanner.
### Spotify â†’ Jellyfin
I did this last year already, after Spotify randomly removed some music. I'm very happy with Jellyfin.

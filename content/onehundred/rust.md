{{ timeline_progressbar(language="Rust") }}

Hi there! In 2018 I decided to set up this little thing where I track my
progress of learning Rust and contributing to its ecosystem.  In March 2019 I
completed the first 100 pull requests and I wrote about it
[here](@/posts/2019-02-18-onehundred-rust-prs.md).

### Why 100?

It's low enough to feel reachable but it also requires a significant amount of
commitment.

### What counts?

I decided to only count contributions to other projects because it prevents me
from cheating the count by creating dozens of small pull requests to my own
projects. It also means that pretty much every PR will benefit the Rust
ecosystem in some way.

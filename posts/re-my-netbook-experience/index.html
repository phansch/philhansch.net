      <div class="e-content"><p><a href="http://phansch.net/2012/01/01/my-netbook-experience/">A year ago</a>, I wrote about my first experiences with the <em>Asus EeePC 1215N</em>. It's time that I do another review of my netbook usage.</p>
<p>I've been running Windows 8 for about two weeks before I removed it. I was unable to connect to my university's eduroam network due to faulty drivers.
Before that, my netbook was running on Windows 7. Running Windows 7 was quite effortless. The reason I gave Windows 8 a try was keyboard accessibility. The new <span class="key">Win</span> + <span class="key">X</span> keyboard shortcut is awesome. The new task manager and file transfer dialog are nice as well. But those just didn't cut it.</p>
<p>The thing is, that my netbook crashed down <em>twice</em>, from 1m height. Because of that, my touch-pad broke and now it stops working a few minutes after start-up. With Windows, I had to bring a mouse with me every time I wanted to use the netbook for longer.
After Windows 8, I decided to give Linux another try. I heard about <a href="http://xmonad.org">XMonad</a>, a tiling window manager, a couple times before, so it was time to reevaluate my netbook usage.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-wanted">What I wanted</h2>
<ul>
<li>A fast and lightweight system</li>
<li>Long battery life</li>
<li>Simple application launcher</li>
<li>Easy note-taking – without a distracting Internet browser</li>
<li>Simple 2D game programming</li>
<li>Everything should be accessible by the keyboard, due to a broken touch-pad</li>
<li>As much screen real estate as possible</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-setup">My setup</h2>
<h4 id="linux-mint-mate">Linux Mint (MATE)</h4>
<p>Frankly, it doesn't really matter what distribution you are using. I opted for Linux Mint because it comes with proper media support and working wireless drivers. After trying the Cinnamon and the MATE desktop, I must say that the Cinnamon desktop felt a bit sluggish compared to the MATE desktop.
I also tried a minimal Debian setup, but I couldn't get the wireless working. If wireless worked out of the box on Debian I probably would have sticked with it.</p>
<h4 id="xmonad">XMonad</h4>
<p>I have been using XMonad for over a month now. I really like it. There are no window decorations and there is no mouse required to do anything.
Windows are closed with <span class="key">Win</span> + <span class="key">Shift</span> + <span class="key">C</span> and that's basically it. Depending on the current layout, the size of the active window can be increased with <span class="key">Win</span> + <span class="key">H</span> and decreased with <span class="key">Win</span> + <span class="key">L</span>. To switch between windows, I use <span class="key">Win</span> + <span class="key">Tab</span>.</p>
<p>My XMonad config just adds a few custom keyboard shortcuts:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="key">Win</span> + <span class="key">Shift</span> + <span class="key">Enter</span> open <code>gnome-terminal</code></li>
<li><span class="key">Win</span> + <span class="key">Shift</span> + <span class="key">P</span> open <code>dmenu</code></li>
<li><span class="key">Win</span> + <span class="key">Shift</span> + <span class="key">V</span> open <code>virtualbox</code></li>
<li><span class="key">Win</span> + <span class="key">S</span> Shutdown</li>
<li><span class="key">Win</span> + <span class="key">Shift</span> + <span class="key">S</span> Suspend</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to see how XMonad can be used, take a look at the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Xmonad/Config_archive#Configs_for_the_current_XMonad_release_.280.9..2A.29">config archive</a>.</p>
<h4 id="filesystem-access-to-google-drive">Filesystem access to Google Drive</h4>
<p>Sadly there is no official Google Drive client for Linux. Therefore you have to rely on third party developers.
To access Google Drive on Linux, you have two options:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Grive/grive">Grive</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.insynchq.com/">Insync</a></li>
</ol>
<p>The main difference between both is that Grive doesn't sync automatically. You have to tell it to sync. Grive also doesn't support symbolic links.
Insync, on the other hand, is a fully functional Google Drive client. Although, the GUI is not working for me. I just keep the application running in the background and it will do the syncing.</p>
<h4 id="sublime-text-2-for-writing-and-web-stuff">Sublime Text 2 for writing and web stuff</h4>
<p>I <a href="http://phansch.net/2012/12/12/running-love2d-from-sublimetext2-on-windows">recently</a> talked about setting up custom Build Systems for Sublime Text 2. Currently I have a build system to build a Love2D project, one for <code>pdflatex</code> and a build system to preview a markdown file in google chrome. I have a small set of shortcuts that I regularly use. I think they are common knowledge, but here are they anyway:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="key">Shift</span> + <span class="key" title="Right Mouse Button">RMB</span> to select columns</li>
<li><span class="key">Shift</span> + <span class="key">Alt</span> + <span class="key">up</span> or <span class="key">down</span> to select columns</li>
<li><span class="key">Ctrl</span> + <span class="key">Shift</span> + <span class="key">P</span> to open the Command Palette</li>
<li><span class="key">Ctrl</span> + <span class="key">B</span> to use the current build system on the current file.</li>
<li><span class="key">F6</span> for spell-checking</li>
</ul>
<p>I also put the settings for ST2 on Google Drive. On a new machine, I can then create symlinks to Google Drive and have the settings and plugins quickly available.</p>
<h4 id="netbeans-for-java-programming-class">NetBeans for Java programming class</h4>
<p>While Sublime Text 2 is an awesome piece of software, I am pretty lazy. At some point, I want to use ST2 to do all the Java stuff for university.
Until then, I'll be using NetBeans. In NetBeans I got rid of a lot of unnecessary UI. I also disabled a lot of plugins to make NetBeans start up faster. It still takes 20 seconds, but that was a huge improvement already.</p>
<h2 id="what-requires-fixing">What requires fixing</h2>
<p>There are a couple things left to do, that could save some time.</p>
<ul>
<li>My git login is not saved to the gnome keyring. Have to login for every push</li>
<li>I still struggle with navigating websites by keyboard.</li>
<li>Use Sublime Text to work on Java assignments.</li>
<li>A few Google Chrome plugins don't sync their settings.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>To wrap things up, I can say that I am really happy with my setup. It was a bumpy road to get there but I think it pays off. The battery lasts for around 4 hours with wireless. For note-taking I use Sublime Text 2 and save notes as markdown. With XMonad, pretty much everything is accomplishable by keyboard shortcuts. And I finally have enough screen space available to do some programming on my netbook.</p>

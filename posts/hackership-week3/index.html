      <div class="e-content"><p>This week was a little bit less about rails and more about front-end stuff. I needed to get some Ajax to work. And that proved to be very difficult. Especially considering that I didn't know in what form rails is expecting PATCH data.</p>
<p>On <strong>Monday</strong> I continued working on the sign-in and sign-out system for the touch-typing website. Once I was done with that, I had to update the user model to include a new column which stores the WPM of users. The <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html">Rails guide for migrations</a> was pretty useful to get that done. In the evening it was time to get to know our Hackers in residence.</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday</strong> started off with a very insightful blogging workshop from <a href="https://twitter.com/laurawadden">@laurawadden</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/sheley">@sheley</a>.
After the blogging workshop, it was time for the Rails Q&amp;A led by <a href="https://twitter.com/freenerd">@freenerd</a>. We talked about <a href="http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html">validations</a> and <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html">associations</a>. After Hackership it was time for <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Berlin-Hack-and-Tell/events/151270052/">Berlin Hack and Tell</a>.</p>
<p>On <strong>Wednesday</strong> one thing I was trying to figure out was: <q>What exactly Rails is expecting from an Ajax request?</q> I spent a lot of time in the development.log and tried to solve various errors. Eventually I got it working with the help of Ben. Once I got it working I was able to make a lot of progress. The WPM of a user is now automatically submitted once the lesson is finished.</p>
<p><strong>Thursday</strong> started in the evening for me. I mainly did some CoffeeScript refactoring. Here are some interesting resources I found helpful:</p>
<h4 id="js2-coffee"><a href="http://js2.coffee/">js2.coffee</a></h4>
<p>This is a CoffeeScript to JavaScript converter. I used it to convert my original JavaScript to CoffeeScript.</p>
<h4 id="smooth-coffeescript-interactive-edition"><a href="http://autotelicum.github.io/Smooth-CoffeeScript/interactive/interactive-coffeescript.html">Smooth CoffeeScript - Interactive Edition</a></h4>
<p>Smooth CoffeeScript is an interactive book on CoffeeScript. I found the <a href="http://autotelicum.github.io/Smooth-CoffeeScript/interactive/interactive-coffeescript.html#functional-programming">chapter on Functional Programming</a> really interesting.</p>
<h4 id="the-little-book-on-coffeescript"><a href="http://arcturo.github.io/library/coffeescript/">The Little Book on CoffeeScript</a></h4>
<p>This book contains a very helpful section on the syntax of CoffeeScript and also a short introduction to Classes.</p>
<p><strong>Friday</strong> is not an official Hackership day, but there was a lot of interest in an Arduino Workshop. So, we started at 12. Since there was an Arduino Workshop the previous Friday which I didn't attend, I had to setup my environment first which went surprisingly smooth. Making the LED's blink was just a matter of about half an hour. I didn't stop at making one LED blink. There was a very difficult practice which required a lot of connectors and resistors. Making sure that everything is connected correctly was not an easy task. The task was to create an LED array to display a certain image. The image was set in a 2D array in the source file. This was a really fun exercise and eventually I got it to work, yay!</p>

<p>That's it for the third week of Hackership. Next week I'm going to work on the database model and some CoffeeScript refactoring.</p>

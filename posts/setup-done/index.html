      <div class="e-content"><p>It took me about two days to get everything set-up. The first day was spent with learning the basics of jekyll, liquid and markdown.</p>
<p>The second day was littered with small challenges and quite a few problems. But problems are there to be solved. So here's my summary of day #2:</p>
<h3 id="setup-a-local-test-environment">Setup a local test environment###</h3>
<p>First thing I did, was figuring out how to setup a local testing environment. The previous day I did 80 commits for testing purposes. That was a little bit too much, in my eyes. Luckily there are quite a few tutorials on how to setup such a test environment. <a href="http://ntotten.com/2012/03/02/github-pages-with-jekyll-local-development-on-windows/">This</a> is the one I used (My desktop machine is running Windows 7). All you need is ruby, the ruby dev kit, jekyll, rdiscount and a clone of your repository.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/images/posts/2012-07-28-Setup-done/commit-frequency.png"><img src="/assets/images/posts/2012-07-28-Setup-done/commit-frequency.png" width="610" alt="commit frequency" title="From 80 down to 18 commits." /></a></p>
<p>So, from 80 commits without a testing environment I went down to 18 commits on day 2.</p>
<h3 id="importing-blog-posts-from-wordpress">Importing blog posts from Wordpress</h3>
<p>As I wanted to keep my old blog posts archived, I looked for ways to convert the Wordpress export xml file to markdown. I eventually found <a href="https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp/">thomasf/exitwp</a> which does exactly what I needed. All that was left to do was getting rid if <code>[caption]</code> tags, making the code look nicer and some general formatting.</p>
<p>I also removed tags and categories from each post as I'm not making use of them. Sadly, embedded YouTube videos were removed by exitwp, so I had to put them in again.</p>
<p>The last thing that was on my list was the code formatting. Apparently there is <a href="http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/">GitHub flavoured markdown</a>. Except that it didn't seem to work on here. After I've spent some time messing around with that, I simply used the basic markdown syntax for code. No syntax highlighting, sadly.
This is also where most of the commits came from. Obviously, GitHub flavored markdown is not available in a local testing environment, so I had to test it on GitHub.</p>
<h3 id="my-own-theme">My own theme</h3>
<p>This theme is a fork of Tom's jekyllbootstrap theme. A few changes to the font, a new archive page and a different footer - That's all I changed. But it's not finished yet. I'm planning to add a "fork me" badge and I might change the footer a little bit. But so far I'm pretty much done.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>Hi, this post is going to be part of a series about productivity,
procrastination and how to form better habits around open-source work.</p>
<p>I can be a terrible procrastinator. Sometimes it's productive procrastination,
other times it's just browsing Reddit or watching YouTube videos. With these
posts I want to share some of my approaches to keep my procrastination at a
non-destructive level.</p>
<p>In retrospect, one key part of this battle has been to move my procrastination
away from the computer and internet and to only use my computer for
non-procrastination things. This post describes the key parts that are working
for me right now.</p>
<h2 id="firefox-extensions">Firefox Extensions</h2>
<p>I'm using two Firefox extensions to limit some of my procrastination:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-unhooked/">Youtube Unhooked</a></strong> is a small extension that will block the more useless parts
of youtube, such as recommendations, related videos and of course, the
comments. I found this useful mostly for hiding the related videos section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/news-feed-eradicator/">Facebook News Feed Eradicator</a></strong> is another very focused extension that will
hide the Facebook news feed. This is useful because I pretty much only use
Facebook for the events part.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You have probably already heard of <strong><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock-ng/">LeechBlock</a></strong>. It worked for me for a
few weeks but I got into the habit of just going to <code>about::addons</code> and
disabling it... Which brings me to my current solution for blocking websites.</p>
<h2 id="etc-hosts-blocklist-with-cronjob"><code>/etc/hosts</code> blocklist with cronjob</h2>
<p>As a replacement for LeechBlock, I've been utilizing my <code>/etc/hosts</code> file for
some time now. Editing it requires me to enter my sudo password which makes it a
bit more difficult to unblock blocked sites. However, it was not difficult
enough. I ended up removing sites from the file and never got around to
add them again.</p>
<p>To solve that problem, I now have an <a href="https://github.com/phansch/dotfiles/blob/35486702f404d6ba4ed514e612a4d20a93e6a41a/ansible/playbooks/procrastination.yml#L11">Ansible playbook</a> that
creates a cronjob which runs every 2 minutes. The cronjob resets the <code>/etc/hosts</code>
file to the contents of a <code>/etc/hosts_base</code> file where all of my go-to
procrastination sites are blocked.</p>
<p>I have found this to work <em>surprisingly</em> well.</p>
<p>Of course, this has potential to fall apart if I start editing <code>/etc/hosts_base</code> but
so far that hasn't been the case.</p>
<h2 id="an-ongoing-fight">An ongoing fight</h2>
<p>I don't claim to have found a perfect solution here. It's more the case that I
think that fighting procrastination is a never ending battle. I will always find
some way to procrastinate. However, by at least limiting some of the bad habits
on my computer, I think that I'm more likely to produce something of value when
I'm using it without distractions.</p>

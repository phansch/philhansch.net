      <div class="e-content"><p>It's hard for me to believe but it's already been <strong>over a year</strong> since I
seriously committed to learning Rust and I have now reached my initial goal of
100 open source contributions to the Rust ecosystem. You can see the full list
<a href="https://philhansch.net/onehundred/rust/">here</a>.</p>

<p>I want to use this blog post to review the work I've done, talk about
the challenges I've come across and how I've tried to deal with them. I'm afraid
I haven't blogged in a long time and this is a bit longer than usual.</p>
<h1 id="clippy">Clippy!</h1>
<p>I decided to work on Clippy for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I love helping people and Clippy is the perfect force multiplier for that</li>
<li>It's quick to iterate on bug fixes and new lints - Running the UI test suite
takes only 1 minute on my machine</li>
<li>It had a lot of reach, with at the time ~2000 GH stars (now at 3000+)</li>
<li>Clippy had (and still has) the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">good first issue</a> label that made finding
tasks super easy</li>
<li>The other contributors were super responsive and helpful</li>
<li>As a jumping point towards more advanced rustc internals</li>
</ul>
<p>I had done some small documentation contributions and was watching other people
contribute new lints and such. With the beginning of 2018 I decided to focus
on Rust in my free time as much as possible. It was also a sort of experiment on
whether I had the grit to stay with a longer-term project.</p>
<h2 id="january-to-march">January to March</h2>
<p>At the beginning of January 2018, my first big Clippy contribution was <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/2340">a
Lint</a> that detects empty lines after outer attributes, such as:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-rust "><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span>#[</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">deny</span><span>(missing_docs)]
</span><span>
</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">fn </span><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">something_to_document</span><span>() { ... }
</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">fn </span><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">more_to_document</span><span>() { ... }
</span></code></pre>
<p>The rationale for this lint is that the attribute was <em>probably</em> meant to be an
inner attribute because it has empty lines that follow. In the process of
writing that lint I learned that there are a <em>lot</em> of things to consider when
linting Rust code and the lint resulted in a few false-positives that I also
fixed.</p>
<p>I think this experience made me aware of how much potential for improvements
there is in Clippy and I decided to spend more time on bug fixing than adding
new lints from then on.</p>
<h2 id="april-to-june">April to June</h2>
<p>To prevent Clippy crashing on essential ecosystem crates, I <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/2764">added an
integration test suite to Clippy</a> that makes sure Clippy doesn't crash
when it's executed on them.</p>
<p>In May I <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/2733">expanded the existing build script</a> to include a check that ensures
a recent nightly release is used to build Clippy. As of now, this has been
removed again because Clippy is now distributed via <a href="https://rustup.rs/">Rustup</a>.</p>
<h2 id="july-to-november">July to November</h2>
<p>From August to November 2018 I rewrote a 300 line python script in Rust to make
it work cross-platform: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/2985">#2985</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/3320">#3320</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/3325">#3325</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/3327">#3327</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/3388">#3388</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/3399">#3399</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/3408">#3408</a>.<br />
If you've contributed a Clippy lint before,
chances are that you've used one of these versions. The rewrite is probably
worth its own blog post at some point.</p>
<h2 id="december-to-february-2019">December to February 2019</h2>
<p>In December I <a href="https://github.com/laumann/compiletest-rs/pull/151">added Rustfix support to the compiletest-rs
library</a>, which in turn <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/3519">allows Clippy</a> to test its
code suggestions. This will prevent suggestion regressions, improve future
suggestions and help pave the path to a reliable Clippy ⟺ Rustfix integration.
This is an ongoing effort and if you want to help out with this, there is an
open <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/3630">tracking issue</a> with some instructions.</p>
<p>In January 2019 I <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/3648">added a lint</a> that detects whether a function can be <code>const</code> or
not. This lint is currently in the <code>nursery</code> group as the <code>const_fn</code> feature is
not fully stabilized yet. You can give it a try by using
<code>#![warn(clippy::missing_const_for_fn)]</code> if you are on beta or nightly.</p>
<h2 id="other-contributions">Other contributions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Not going into further detail, I also <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+author%3Aphansch+is%3Aclosed+Fix+in%3Atitle">fixed about 20 bugs and crashes</a>
in Clippy over this time. Of those, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/2763">this one</a> is probably my favorite
fix. I also <a href="https://philhansch.net/posts/fixing-a-clippy-crash/">wrote a blog post</a> about one of them.</li>
<li>I <a href="https://github.com/softprops/hubcaps/pull/142">added</a> the ability to create GitHub review comments to <a href="https://github.com/softprops/hubcaps">hubcaps</a></li>
<li>I <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/56792">made the tests</a> of rustc's <code>compiletest</code> runnable via <code>./x.py</code></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="did-it-work">Did it work?</h1>
<p>I specifically started this project to improve my grit for longer-term projects
and I would say that it worked. Together with other things, working on Clippy
helped me to increase my focus to stick through harder tasks.</p>
<p>Working on crashes where I know next to nothing in the beginning is <em>really</em>
hard motivation wise. In one case it has caused me to step away for a couple of
weeks. This is something that I want to still work on.</p>
<p>I also want to solidify more fundamentals. When I go to the Rust Berlin learners
meetup I sometimes feel like I can't explain some things properly. I suppose one
problem of fixing bugs in Clippy is that there's not a lot of general Rust
knowledge to learn. It's more about very specific rustc or Clippy internals.</p>
<h1 id="what-s-next">What's next?</h1>
<p>For the reasons mentioned at the beginning, I will absolutely continue working
on Clippy and focus on improving its reliability. I am currently reworking the
contribution guidelines to lower the bar of entry for new contributors and then
want to get back to fixing bugs and crashes.</p>
<p>However, I also want to improve my fundamentals. To do that, I'm expanding my
Anki card collection to be able to recall more from memory and going through
TRPL a second time.</p>
<p>On to the next hundred contributions!</p>

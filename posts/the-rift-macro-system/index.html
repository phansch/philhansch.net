      <div class="e-content"><p>As you may or may not know, I have a gaming section over at games.phansch.de (no longer maintained) where I keep stuff for various games.
Most importantly, I wrote a macro translator that translates Rift macros written in English, to German and the other way around. Today, I want to talk about the pitfalls of Rift's macro and command system and possible solutions.</p>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>When I started playing Rift, I would usually use the English client because I preferred the English forums over the German forums for its up-to-date guides and tutorials. Still, I was playing on a German server because I preferred to play with people who speak my native language (being lazy here!).</p>
<p>As mentioned, I was always more in touch with the international community than the German community, except for my guild. I was <a href="#">quite active on telarapedia (link dead unfortunately)</a>, for example. The downside of using the English client was, that communicating with my guild was sometimes difficult. So I eventually switched to the German client. And here the trouble begins.</p>
<p>I quickly noticed that all my macros stopped working. Apparently Trion localized parts of the macro syntax into German! So I started to figure out what was going on ~</p>
<h3 id="what-s-so-wrong">What’s so wrong</h3>
<p>The way Rift macros are localized into the additional supported languages (German and French) is kind of weird.</p>
<p>First of all, when using a localized client, the macro system expects the localized ability/item names, not the English ones, which is fine. Furthermore, certain key modifiers have been localized. For example, <em>[ctrl]</em> becomes <em>[strg]</em> in German. And most importantly all the emotes are localized.</p>
<p>And here the real trouble begins. Some parts aren't localized. Take the _/cas_t command. It works in the German client as well and there doesn't seem to be a translation for it. As well as the <em>suppressmacrofailures</em> command. However, there once was a German translation available for it but stopped working a few updates ago.</p>
<!--[![](http://wpimages.phansch.de/2012/02/macro.jpg)](http://wpimages.phansch.de/2012/02/macro.jpg)-->
<p>Then there are certain emotes in the German client that allow you to use both the English and the German command: <em>/dance</em> and <em>/tanzen</em> will both work in the German client! These are just a few examples I stumbled across when I was writing up the <a href="http://telarapedia.gamepedia.com/Commands">Commandlist</a> over at Telarapedia during beta.</p>
<h3 id="possible-solutions">Possible solutions</h3>
<p>The most obvious solution would be for Trion to streamline the command and macro system. Adding a documentation of what is possible and what isn't, is needed anyway. The <em>/help</em> command which just prints the list of commands is just not enough. However, that will require a lot of work. And the small macro system probably isn't worth the work. It works fine, as long as people don't change the client language.</p>
<p>For me, there's also the option to move to an English speaking server. And I might end up doing that soon.</p>

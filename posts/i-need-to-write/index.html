      <div class="e-content"><p>I need to write.
I initially planned to split this over a few posts, but my notes kept growing and now I'm at a point where I have to get rid of all the notes and formulate a proper blog post.
So, the past few months were kinda crazy.</p>
<p>I'm pretty much done with playing video games for the time being. My last big game was Guild Wars 2. I even had a <a href="#">small ambitious blog project</a> which I took care of for 5 months. I gave Planetside 2 a try and played with friends for a few days. It was fun but after a while it was all the same. I think that was the case with every MMO I've tried.</p>
<p>##When I started simplifying##</p>
<p>It wasn't after I quitting Guild Wars 2 when I started to realize that I kept refreshing social networks and news all the time. Looking for new blog posts, insightful videos and ted talks.
I constantly got disrupted doing whatever I really wanted to do. Looking at Twitter or watching an hour-long ted talk. In the end I came to realize that I was wasting time while I neglected important university stuff. This was a major life-changer for me: <em>Realizing that I cannot read every single news story, lifehacker article and blog post out there</em>. Someone pointed me to <a href="http://zenhabits.net/online-reading/">a post from Leo Babauta on zenhabits.net</a> which talks about letting go of that stuff.</p>
<p>From there on, I pretty much started re-evaluating my behavior. One information source replaced the last one and then removing the new information source. This has led me to a point where I only check Hacker News, reddit and email for half an hour in the morning and half an hour in the evening. On a similar note, I also got rid of my TV but I must admit that I wasn't watching TV anyway (German TV is terrible).</p>
<p>##My personal toolbox##
My next step was creating a small set of programs to do work for university. So, I sat down and came up with some requirements for my toolbox:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to have my documents in a single location, available everywhere and easy to backup.</li>
<li>Initial setup should be as simple as possible.</li>
<li>Every tool should allow online synchronization, so I can continue working wherever there's internet available.</li>
<li>Programming and tinkering environment should be running on a virtual machine to allow easy backups and easy installation.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where it got complicated. First, I cut down on redundant software. I got rid of Wunderlist in favor of Evernote. I'm now using <a href="http://gtdfh.branchable.com/" title="Getting things done for hackers">GTDFH</a> to organize my projects in Evernote. I also got rid of Microsoft Office. Instead I'm using a combination of Evernote, <a href="https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js">impress.js</a> for presentations and Google Docs.
I also made the switch from Firefox to Google Chrome to keep my browser in sync.</p>
<p>My programming environment is running on a Windows 7 virtual machine right now. That machine has a local jekyll server, netbeans for java programming, python and a simple xampp server. My second virtual machine is running Linux Mint with a database client for my postgres class. My university is also providing git repositories, so I'm using these instead of of a public GitHub repository, to keep my programming assignments private.</p>
<p>##Call me minimalist, if you want##
After slowly gaining control over my online life, I started devoting my time to the place I live in. I've always been rather tidy. My mom taught me to always clean up on the go. But I didn't really do that until I moved away from my parents. Having my own place changed that. It also made me reconsider keeping all the stuff I own.</p>
<p>Having less stuff, makes cleaning a lot easier. Buying less stuff saves a ton of money. Owning only the clothes you <em>really</em> like, makes picking clothes in the morning really easy. And, after all, having less stuff makes moving very easy. I donated half of my books to friends and family and I'm now using a Kindle. One third of my clothes went to charity. I digitized old photos and sold my games collection to a local video game shop. Having less stuff freed my mind.</p>
<p>So where do I go from now? I'm happy with where I am now. I can focus on the most important stuff (university), get it done and then focus on personal projects without getting distracted.
I still have a few things to write about. I hope to be able to publish them this year.
This blog also needs some updates to the theme. But that's for another blog post.</p>

      <div class="e-content"><p>Things changed a lot but I didn't feel in the mood to really keep the blog up-to date. Now I'll have to pay for it. This will be quite a lengthy post. I'll go over the recent website changes first, then go on with my second foray into Guild Wars 2. I also started learning Ruby, so I'll go into more detail further down. And there's also an update about my netbook experience. Here's what happened in chronological order.</p>
<h2 id="one-game-a-month">One Game A Month</h2>
<p>I haven't finished any new games after February. I had a <a href="https://gitlab.com/phansch/shootingstar/tree/master">side-scroller</a> in the works but that project is still way too over ambitious in terms of content creation. I'm not sure if I will get around to finishing that one. I might start a new game from scratch instead.</p>
<h2 id="guild-wars-2">Guild Wars 2</h2>
<p>This topic is really hard for me to talk about because it really messed with my goals and plans for this year. Let this be a warning for future me. After finishing the winter semester at university I lost interest in creating games and started playing games instead. I was caught up in Guild Wars 2 again. The last time was crazy too. I even <a href="https://philhansch.net/posts/character-diversity-in-guild-wars-2/">had</a> a <a href="https://philhansch.net/posts/sketchbook-fear-and-horror-in-mmos/">blog</a> <a href="https://philhansch.net/posts/this-week-in-guild-wars-2-w10/">dedicated</a> <a href="https://philhansch.net/posts/elementalist-introduction/">to</a> <a href="https://philhansch.net/posts/this-week-in-guildwars2-w9/">the</a> <a href="https://philhansch.net/posts/this-week-in-guild-wars-2-w11/">game</a> before it came out.</p>
<p>This time it took up 5 months of the year. I slowly grew more and more attached to my character. Until there was a point where it only made sense to keep playing. "Otherwise the time I spent playing before that would have obviously been wasted", I reasoned. Meeting a group of nice players and slowly starting to carry responsibility for in-game stuff made it worse.</p>
<p>Luckily there came a point where I grew sick of it. That was at at the end of August. I still remember that moment. I wish I knew what triggered it. It might have taken a few minutes, but I slowly lost all sense of attachment to my characters. It's as if there was a dense cover of fog suddenly removed from my vision. A few days after that I brought myself to delete my Guild Wars 2 characters as well as all my EVE Online characters. I never want to touch MMOs again.</p>
<h2 id="ruby">Ruby</h2>
<p>It took me a week to get things going again. I started learning Ruby. Because, why not? The first tutorial I took was the one at <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-ruby">Codeschool</a>. After that I stuck with Codeschool and continued with the Ruby courses. However, I felt as if those tutorials skipped a lot of Ruby fundamentals.</p>
<p>After the first month I un-enrolled from Codeschool to continue with <em><a href="https://gitlab.com/phansch/100-projects/tree/master">Projects</a></em>. Projects is a GitHub repository consisting of over 100 programming projects compiled by GitHub user <a href="https://github.com/thekarangoel">thekarangoel</a>. I'm not done with Projects yet but I decided it was about time to give Test Driven Development a try: <a href="https://gitlab.com/phansch/learn_ruby_solutions/tree/master">Learn Ruby (Solutions)</a> from <a href="http://testfirst.org/learn_ruby">testfirst.org/learn_ruby</a>. I never wrote tests before, so this was a really fun learning experience.</p>
<hr />
<p>My most recent journey into Ruby is <a href="https://github.com/phansch/jou">jou</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jou is a simple command line utility that helps with maintaining a journal file in markdown syntax.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm using a journal file to keep track of what I did each day. Like writing a blog post or making changes to the website. It's part of my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">gtd</a> process. At some point I got sick of locating and opening my journal file in a text editor, so it only made sense to make life easier. Feel free to give it a try by installing it with <code>gem install jou</code>.</p>
<h2 id="website-changes">Website changes</h2>
<p>As you might have noticed, the website underwent quite some changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using Bootstrap 3.0</li>
<li>Proper <a href="http://phansch.net/">Portfolio</a></li>
<li>Feedburner RSS feed has been replaced with a simple <a href="http://phansch.net/atom.xml">atom.xml</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="netbook-toolset-changes">Netbook / Toolset changes</h2>
<p>So, this is the third and last part of my netbook experience. My requirements have changed a lot since I <a href="https://philhansch.net/posts/my-netbook-experience/">first</a> wrote about it. I also modified the setup I described in the <a href="https://philhansch.net/posts/re-my-netbook-experience/">second post</a> a bit.</p>
<p>After using it for roughly two years, my netbook felt very underpowered. The processor was weak and watching HD videos was a thing of the past. The battery was dead and the touchpad was broken. Coupled with the fact that I'm not seriously playing games anymore, I want to get rid of my PC as well.</p>
<h4 id="what-i-want">What I want</h4>
<ul>
<li>A simple, minimal and lightweight system</li>
<li>Keyboard-heavy interface as it's faster</li>
<li>As much screen real estate as possible</li>
<li>Long battery life</li>
<li>8G memory and a SSD</li>
<li>Hardware fully supported by Linux</li>
<li>2 Monitor support</li>
</ul>
<p>The solution is the Dell XPS 13. It's going to replace my netbook <em>and</em> my PC. And it will be able to run my current Linux environment.</p>
<h3 id="my-current-environment">My current environment</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a> on Linux Mint 15 Xfce with two 24" screens.</li>
<li>Mail: <a href="http://www.mutt.org/">mutt</a></li>

<li>Other: Firefox, Skype, VLC, JDownloader</li>

</ul>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://gist.github.com/phansch/6990647">here's a setup script</a> to install everything from a basic Linux Mint installation. (Use at your own risk.)</p>

      <div class="e-content"><h2 id="sponsors">Sponsors</h2>
<p>I'm really excited about December's new bronze sponsor:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/EmbarkStudios">Embark Studios</a> ðŸŽ‰</p>
<p>They have been supporting all kinds of open source Rust contributors this past
year and are a huge boon to the Rust community. I'm exited to work with them to
bring more Clippy features on the way!</p>
<p>I also want to thank the following people for continued sponsorship of my open
source work this past month: <a href="https://github.com/repi">@repi</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oli-obk">@oli-obk</a> and <a href="https://github.com/yaahc">@yaahc</a>.</p>
<p>If you like what I'm doing and want to support my work as well, please consider
sponsoring me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/philhansch">Patreon</a> or <a href="https://philhansch.net/thanks/">via other
means</a> ðŸ§¡</p>
<h2 id="what-i-ve-worked-on">What I've worked on</h2>
<p>4 code contributions got merged this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/6413">Rewrite update-all-references bash scripts in Rust</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/6473">Separate suspicious_else_formatting tests</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/6471">Fix blessing of new reference files</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/6485">Don't trigger large_enum_variant in external macros</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I've reviewed and approved <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Amerged+Approved+by%3A+phansch+merged%3A2020-12-01..2020-12-31+">2 pull requests</a>.</p>
<p>Of those, the most rewarding work was rewriting Clippy's internal
'update-reference' scripts. These scripts are used by contributors to update the
reference files when test output has changed. Rewriting the scripts in Rust
should make contributing from Windows much easier.</p>
<h2 id="reflections">Reflections</h2>
<p>Working from home during the lockdowns really messed with my daily routines and
habits. Now that there is hope for an end to the pandemic I have been able to
fix my lack of motivation that plagued me in the past months. I didn't get a lot
done from July to November. Outside of work I didn't have the energy to touch
any more code at all.</p>

  </a>
</div>
<p>In October I also <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/highfive/pull/295">removed myself from the reviewer rotation</a> for Clippy
and handed my pending reviews to the other members of the team. In retrospect, I
should have done that much earlier. This break from open source was something I
really needed and I won't hesitate to do this again in the future.</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>My primary goal for January is to make Clippy's UI test blessing work from the
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/tools/clippy">rustc subtree checkout</a>. I have a working prototype locally but as I have not much
experience with the rustc tooling, I expect some edge cases will be uncovered
once my code is being reviewed.</p>
<p>This work will enable rustc contributors to update the Clippy UI test reference
files without any issues and with their familiar tooling.</p>
<p>Apart from that I'm going to re-add myself to the reviewer rotation for Clippy
and start reviewing larger pull requests again.</p>

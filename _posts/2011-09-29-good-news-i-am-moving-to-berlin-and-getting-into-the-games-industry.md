Just wanted to let you readers know, that I'm now on the move to Berlin.

I'll be studying Applied Computer Science (Angewandte Informatik in German) at [HTW Berlin](http://www.htw-berlin.de/en) for at least the next 3 years. 

For now, I am trying out some shared living and see how that works out. Unfortunately I won't have internet right off the start. But that's one of the things on my high priority list. 

In order to keep this blog alive, I have scheduled a few posts about various topics for the next two weeks.

## Future plans

During the time in Berlin I will be concentrating most of my efforts on **getting a step into the games industry as a games programmer** (C++/DirectX). I could have just chosen to study Game Design but I wanted to have a more general degree in case something goes wrong.

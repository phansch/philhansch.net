[@nerdbabe](https://twitter.com/nerdbabe) retweeted [this awesome](http://scripting.com/2014/03/01/whyBlog.html) blog post by [Dave Winer](https://twitter.com/davewiner) today. I just wanted to share this gem of inspiration with you.

 > The mission of blogging is to empower all of us to go directly to each other with our expertise. So if you know something as well as anyone else, or you learn something or know something that should be shared, then you should share it on your blog.

 > Blogging needs your help. There's cobwebs in the blogosphere. I want to dust everything off, and start linking our stuff together, and get some developer energy flowing, and let's do some new stuff.

I have a couple ideas for upcoming blog posts, but if you want me to write about something specific, feel free to add an issue [here](https://gitlab.com/phansch/phansch-net/issues/new) or just [send me a tweet](http://twitter.com/philhansch).

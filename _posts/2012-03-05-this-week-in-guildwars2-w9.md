This week was packed with new videos from the recent press beta as well as new information about the beta invites. Without any further ado, here's what happened the past week.


**Monday** started out pretty quiet. However, later in the day NCsoft announced that the next closed beta will [take place in late march](http://massively.joystiq.com/2012/02/27/guild-wars-2-beta-signups-peaked-at-4-000-a-minute/). Yogscast also released the [Guardian Spotlight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPRmFQHjSpY) on YouTube. Ah, yes Garret Fuller from mmorpg.com talks about his [impressions on the Ranger class](http://www.mmorpg.com/gamelist.cfm/game/473/feature/6129/Ranger-Preview.html).

On **Tuesday** Yogscast released another part of their class spotlight: [The Elementalist](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiuNbqPWpEo). Oh, and Jon Peters is going into detail on Traits and Attributes on the ArenaNet Blog (link dead)! Furthermore, the guys from mmorpg.com have been pretty active this day. William Murphy from [takes a look at the Engineer class](http://www.mmorpg.com/gamelist.cfm/game/473/feature/6132/The-Engineer-Preview.html) and David North talks about his [overall Beta impressions](http://www.mmorpg.com/gamelist.cfm/game/473/feature/6133/Beta-Reflections.html). Wrapping up Tuesday, Elisabeth Cardy from Massively [talks about PVE](http://massively.joystiq.com/2012/02/28/flameseeker-chronicles-i-hope-you-like-pve-stuff/) in her weekly Flameseker Chronicles.

**Wednesday** German fansite Wartower.de released a [new TowerTalk](http://www.wartower.de/news/news.php?id=4646) with Jeff Grubb talking about the Asura. The introduction is German but the interview itself is held in English. David North from mmorpg.com also gave a [preview of the Guardian](http://www.mmorpg.com/gamelist.cfm/game/473/feature/6139/The-Guardian-Preview.html) class.

**Thursday** TotalBiscuit published two new videos. One [details the jumping puzzle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYj2QMEPRT0) we've seen in a previous video and the other one shows a little bit of [Warrior game-play](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4UWZ2XN9rs). Yogscast also released the last part of their class spotlights, [the Warrior Spotlight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA6TPoWWdV0). A good day for you Warriors out there! There's also an [article on the Elementalist](http://www.mmorpg.com/gamelist.cfm/game/473/feature/6142/The-Elementalist-Preview.html) over at mmorpg.com

On **Friday** Yogscast released the [first part of their dungeon play-through](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG3tEl9FF9s). GuildCast also published their new episode: Peer Pressure where they are talking about WvW coordination, possible changes to the particle effects and the marketplace.

The **weekend** was far from quiet. GW2Gurus own Lewis B. [goes into detail on the Traits system](#top) (forum does not exist anymore) that ArenaNet talked about on their blog on Tuesday. Yogscast released the [second part of their dungeon play-through](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGNSuIqvezI) and the [first part of their Norn levelling series](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP1INgvPmVE). Over at borderhouseblog, Quinnae Moongazer has published the first part of an interview (note: link broken) with Angel Leigh McCoy, one of the writers at ArenaNet working on Guild Wars 2.

_This weekly got a little short. There are probably a dozen interviews and a couple more videos I missed during my time in hospital. But I'm fine now and next weeks weekly will be even bigger!_

I am participating in the **[One Game A Month](http://www.onegameamonth.com/) challenge**. Each month, I am going to show off a finished game.
[Last month's Ludum Dare](/2012/12/26/ludum-dare-25-post-mortem) taught me how important it is to plan ahead. And *to stick to your plan*.

Here's what I've planned in order to complete the challenge.

1. The first weekend of the month is where I will finish the majority of the game.
2. I will then use the rest of the time to add polish. 
3. Every Sunday, a new game update is published on this blog. The game should be in a playable state without any obvious bugs.
4. Use game jams whenever possible.
5. Use the GitHub Issue System for monitoring my progress. I have a milestone for 1GAM setup [here](https://github.com/phansch/phansch.github.com/issues?milestone=2&page=1&state=open).
5. Tech: For now it's [Lua](http://www.lua.org) + [Love2D](http://love2d.org) + [hump](http://vrld.github.com/hump/).


See you next Sunday!
